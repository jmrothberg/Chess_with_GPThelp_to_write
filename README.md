A game of chess written with the help of GTP4
I always wanted to write a game of chess that would beat me, so with GPT4 as my helper I did.
Co-pilot in VSCODE was not really that helpful.  I had to take code, usually just a few functions and past it into my own GPT4 chatbot. I use my own, since I can edit my chat history.
ChatGPT4 was great at times for finding bugs, but terribl at logic.  So I would often get a function, and then have to work the logic by hand. For example on the min/max, it wrote a good outline, but could not get the logic right.
